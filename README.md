# Overview

Built a real estate website using React with a clean and interactive UI. Added a property slider using Swiper.js and smooth animations with Framer Motion. Used CountUp.js to show real-time stats like available properties and happy clients. Included an accordion section to highlight property values and benefits. Designed a responsive navbar with a mobile-friendly menu. Created a contact section where users can call, chat, or message. Showcased partner company logos for credibility. Pulled property data dynamically. Optimized performance with web vitals tracking. The site is responsive, scalable, and easy to use!
